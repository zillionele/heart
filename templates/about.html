                    This heart disease prediction system uses a machine learning model built with scikit-learn to analyze 
                    heart rate and blood glucose data. The model processes these inputs to estimate the potential risk of 
                    heart disease based on patterns it has learned from medical data.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The system uses a neural network architecture that has been trained on synthetic data for demonstration 
                    purposes. In a real-world application, the model would be trained on extensive clinical data from 
                    patients with known heart disease outcomes.

                    When you input your heart rate and blood glucose values, the system:

                    <li>Preprocesses your data by scaling it to a range the model can work with</li>
                    <li>Passes the processed data through the neural network</li>
                    <li>Obtains a probability score representing the estimated risk</li>
                    <li>Categorizes the risk as Low, Moderate, or High based on the probability</li>
                    <li>Presents the results with visualizations to help you understand the assessment</li>

                    While our system provides a risk assessment based on heart rate and blood glucose, it's important to 
                    understand that heart disease risk depends on many more factors, including:

                <h5>Heart Rate</h5>
                <p>
                    Resting heart rate is an indicator of cardiovascular health. Studies have shown that elevated resting 
                    heart rates may be associated with increased risk of cardiovascular events. A normal resting heart rate 
                    for adults typically ranges from 60 to 100 beats per minute, with lower rates generally indicating better 
                    cardiovascular fitness.
                </p>
                
                <h5 class="mt-4">Blood Glucose</h5>
                <p>
                    Elevated blood glucose levels are associated with diabetes, which is a significant risk factor for heart 
                    disease. Normal fasting blood glucose levels typically range from 70 to 100 mg/dL. Levels above 126 mg/dL 
                    may indicate diabetes, while levels between 100 and 125 mg/dL suggest prediabetes.

                <p class="mt-4">
                    While these two factors provide valuable information, comprehensive risk assessment requires evaluation 
                    of multiple factors by healthcare professionals.
